# DarkTube

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/amo/v/darktube.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darktube/)

A Firefox/Chrome extension that forces YouTube to use dark theme.
It also removes some minor annoyances (e.g. default autoplay when not set by the user).
It works in private windows as well (if allowed).
