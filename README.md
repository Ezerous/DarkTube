# DarkTube

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/amo/v/darktube.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darktube/)

Firefox extension that forces YouTube to use dark theme.
It removes some minor annoyances as well (e.g. default autoplay when not set by the user and a few annoying tooltips/banners).
Also works in private windows (if allowed).
